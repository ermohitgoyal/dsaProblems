# 🚀 DSA Problems in C#

Welcome to the **dsaProblems** repository!  
This project is a growing collection of Data Structures and Algorithms problems solved using **C#**, with each solution organized neatly into classes.

---

## 📌 Purpose

This repository serves as:

- A personal learning log for mastering DSA with C#
- A ready-to-use library of common algorithmic problems
- A reference for interview preparation
- A portfolio of clean, efficient, and testable DSA implementations

---

## 📂 Project Structure

Each problem is implemented as a separate class file with a clear naming convention.


- `Problems/`: Contains individual classes for each DSA problem.
- `Program.cs`: Entry point for testing or running individual solutions.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Language: **C#**
- Framework: **.NET 6 / .NET 7**
- IDE: Visual Studio / VS Code
